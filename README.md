# Algorithm-Assignment6
KalAcademy - Assignment6 
This assignment contains writing algorithms and making descriptive videos for the algorithems which is accessible through this file, 
and also this repository includes all the implemented algorithms:
1- Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S.


2-Given a string, recursively remove adjacent duplicate characters from string. The output string should not have any adjacent duplicates. See following examples.


3-Given two strings, the task is to find if a string ('a') can be obtained by rotating another string ('b') by two places.


4- Given an string in roman no format (s)  your task is to convert it to integer .


 

5-Given two strings ‘X’ and ‘Y’, find the length of the longest common substring.
 



6- Given a string, find length of the longest substring with all distinct characters.  For example, for input "abca", the output is 3 as "abc" is the longest substring with all distinct characters.


7-Your task  is to implement the function atoi. The function takes a string(str) as argument and converts it to an integer and returns it.


8-Your task  is to implement the function strstr. The function takes two strings as arguments(s,x) and  locates the occurrence of the string x in the string s. The function returns and integer denoting  the first occurrence of the string x .


9-Given a array of Nstrings, find the longest common prefix among all strings present in the array.


10-Design a URL shortner like bit.ly
